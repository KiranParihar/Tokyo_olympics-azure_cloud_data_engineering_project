# Tokyo_olympics-azure_cloud_data_engineering_project

## <ins>Objective of Project:</ins>
The objective of this project is to take the raw data of Tokyo Olympics and transform it using various Azure cloud services and find the insights from it and also to create a dashboard which will help in understanding the insights in simpler and efficient way.

## <ins>Tools and Technologies used:</ins>
- Microsoft Excel
- Azure Databricks
- Azure Data Factory
- Azure Synapse Analytics
- Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2
- Power BI

## <ins>Steps performed from Raw Data to Dashboard:</ins>

**Azure Data Factory:** Initiated the project by leveraging Azure Data Factory to streamline the orchestration of the data integration process. This facilitated the efficient construction of the pipeline, ensuring a seamless and uninterrupted data flow.

**Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2:** We securely stored raw data in Azure Data Lake Gen 2, establishing a centralized repository for our operations. The flexibility of Data Lake enabled me to efficiently manage and scale resources as needed.

**Azure Databricks:**  For the purposes of data cleansing and transformation, we utilize Azure Databricks, harnessing its capabilities to enhance the quality and structure of the data.

**Azure Data Lake Storage Gen 2:** After undergoing transformation, the refined data has been reintegrated into Data Lake Storage, where it is now enriched and prepared for the upcoming phase.

**Azure Synapse Analytics:** Leverage the Synapse Analytics service to execute SQL queries on processed data, uncovering valuable insights.

**Power BI:** The meticulously processed data, seamlessly integrated into Azure Data Lake Gen 2 storage, served as the foundation for our endeavors. Ultimately, we leveraged this transformed dataset and unveil the Tokyo Olympics 2020 information through an impressive visual dashboard crafted with Power BI.
